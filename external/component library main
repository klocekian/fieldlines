You are tasked with creating a component library based on a screenshot using React, and Tailwind CSS.

All components should be custom-made to match the screenshot as closely as possible.

Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Analyze the provided screenshot.

2. Identify distinct UI components in the screenshot. These may include, but are not limited to, ◦ Buttons ◦ Input fields ◦ Navigation bars ◦ Cards ◦ Modals ◦ Typography elements

3. For each identified component:

a. Create a React functional component.

b. Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the component, matching the visual design in the screenshot.

c. Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.

d. Add any necessary props for customization.

e. Include a brief comment describing the component’s purpose.

4. After creating all individual components, create an index page that imports and displays each component with example usage.

Remember to use only custom-made components and Tailwind CSS classes. Do not use any external libraries or pre-built components.

Strive to match the visual design in the screenshot as closely as possible while maintaining good coding practices and component reusability.
