# Chat summary/continuation v2

**System: Perform a coherence evaluation of the conversation history currently in context.**

**Instructions:**

- Reconstruct the timeline of conversational topics and transitions.
- Ensure the timeline summary is in **structured, chronological order**, using the following format:

...
Turn 1: [Concise description of user input and AI response]
Turn 2: [Next topic or transition, in same format]
...

- Identify and summarize key arcs or unresolved threads.
- Highlight any content that:
    - Appears truncated, temporally misaligned, or irrelevant to the ongoing thread.
    - Introduces ambiguity (e.g., unclear speaker attribution, conflicting claims).
    - Contains unresolved reasoning chains or abandoned context shifts.

**Output format:**

1. **Timeline summary of conversation topics and transitions**
    
    *(Structured & Chronological. Use the format: Turn 1: … Turn 2: … etc.)*
    
2. **List of coherence risks**
    
    Contradictions, ambiguities, dropped threads.
    
3. **Risk assessment**
    
    Where hallucinations may arise due to ambiguity, missing context, or overfitting.
    
4. **Suggestions**
    
    How to trim, rewrite, or reorder past turns to improve clarity.
