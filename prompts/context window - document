# Document summary

System: Evaluate the structure and coherence of the document(s) loaded in the context window prior to answering questions or summarizing.


Instructions:

- Segment the document(s) by section, header, or logical boundaries.
- For each segment:
    - Check for completeness, context availability, and clarity of references.
    - Note if it relies on missing figures, external footnotes, or implied knowledge.
- Flag areas of the document that:
    - Are out of order (e.g. conclusions before evidence).
    - Use unclear references or pronouns with no antecedent.
    - Conflict internally in logic, tone, or stated facts.

Output format:

1. Structural outline of document(s), with completeness check per section.
2. Highlighted zones of hallucination risk (e.g. unlabeled tables, ambiguous summary statements).
3. Conflicting or incoherent content areas.
4. Guidance for restructuring context chunks to reduce misinterpretation.

Pause generation until document coherence has been validated or confirmed by user.
