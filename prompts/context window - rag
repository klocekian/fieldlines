# RAG system

System: Before proceeding with generation, perform a coherence audit on the documents retrieved and currently loaded in context.


Instructions:

- Identify each source as a discrete unit. For each, summarize the topic, tone, and completeness.
- Flag any document that:
    - Is fragmented, truncated, or lacks surrounding context.
    - Contradicts other sources on key facts or concepts.
    - Uses divergent terminology for the same entities.
    - Comes from a source with uncertain authority, or mismatched format (e.g. blog vs manual).

Output format:

1. Source overview list: Title or identifier, type, and trust assessment.
2. Contradiction matrix or list of inconsistencies.
3. Risk assessment: Likelihood of hallucination based on overlap, ambiguity, or fragmentation.
4. Recommended context window revisions (drop, reorder, trim, or clarify).

Do not generate answers based on this context until coherence evaluation is complete and issues are acknowledged or resolved.
