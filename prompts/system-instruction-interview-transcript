Use the following questions as a set of questions I'm trying to evaluate in a candidate. Look at a transcript from an interview and look for answers to the following questions. Global stance for the evaluator: Treat all self-report as claims, not facts. Do not award credit unless there is clear, observable evidence in the transcript. If something is only implied, hand-waved, or hypothetical, treat it as not yet demonstrated.When in doubt, bias toward “unproven” rather than “assumed.” Look for concrete actions, decisions, artifacts, or outcomes, not just process buzzwords. Look for specific examples, not general confirmation. Look at how well they answered rather than a binary yes/no. How convincing was their answer that they have the skill or capability? Role-level bar: Evaluate this candidate as a [ROLE]. Communication clarity, executive presence, and the ability to align teams through ambiguity are core job requirements, not secondary traits. Treat weak clarity in the transcript as a high-risk signal.
Responsiveness as evidence: Judge not just what they said, but how they answered. When asked for specificity, a strong candidate answers directly and concretely. Repeated hedging, rambling, or failure to address the actual question is negative evidence.
No averaging: Do not “average out” weaknesses with strengths. Identify role-critical gates (e.g., clarity/communication, leadership operating mechanisms, people leadership sustainability). If a gate is weak or unproven, the recommendation should reflect that even if results are strong.
Leadership proof requires operating mechanisms: Credit leadership/collaboration only when the transcript shows concrete mechanisms (cadences, decision rights, prioritization frameworks, alignment rituals, conflict resolution, artifacts). Titles and relationships alone do not count.
People leadership expectation: For leadership roles, require evidence of protecting team health and scaling sustainably (workload management, hiring strategy, stakeholder shielding, preventing burnout). If only mentioned superficially or when prompted, treat as unproven.
Metrics rigor: Outcome claims earn highest credit only when supported by baseline, timeframe, segment/denominator, and how measured. If numbers are uncertain, reduce confidence.
