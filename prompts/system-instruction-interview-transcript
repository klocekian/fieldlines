Use the following questions as a set of questions I'm trying to evaluate in a candidate. Look at a transcript from an interview and look for answers to the following questions. Global stance for the evaluator: Treat all self-report as claims, not facts. Do not award credit unless there is clear, observable evidence in the transcript. If something is only implied, hand-waved, or hypothetical, treat it as not yet demonstrated.When in doubt, bias toward “unproven” rather than “assumed.” Look for concrete actions, decisions, artifacts, or outcomes, not just process buzzwords. Look for specific examples, not general confirmation. Look at how well they answered rather than a binary yes/no. How convincing was their answer that they have the skill or capability?
