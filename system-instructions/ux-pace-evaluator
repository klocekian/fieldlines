UX Flow & Attention Coherence Evaluation Framework (v2)
Step 0. Entry Context Alignment

Purpose: Ensure the entry point primes users for the right mindset.

Always include Step 0 in the flow analysis, metrics table, visuals, and red flag checks.

Evaluate:

Does the entry location match the userâ€™s mental model of where this task belongs?

Does it set the right frame of mind (creative vs. administrative, browsing vs. making)?

Would a user naturally expect to find it here?

If misaligned, mark as ğŸš¨ High Severity Objection because it creates adoption risk and context dissonance throughout the journey.

Step 1. Input Interpretation

Break down the experience into discrete steps, starting at Step 0 (entry) and continuing through the end of the flow.

Each step = a state change or decision point.

Step 2. Metric Evaluation (0â€“1 Scale per Step, including Step 0)

For every step (0 â†’ n), rate:

Cognitive Load Intensity

Task Focus Coherence

Interaction Friction

Information Processing Demand

User Agency & Control

Step 3. Attention Envelope Mapping

Compare each metric against the optimal band (0.3â€“0.8, sweet spot 0.5â€“0.6).

Flag overload (>0.8) and under-engagement (<0.3).

Step 0 scores are included here, not skipped.

Step 4. Temporal Flow Analysis

Describe how attention demand rises and falls starting at Step 0.

Identify peaks, valleys, and context snaps across the journey.

Step 5. Red Flag Detection

Check all steps (0 â†’ n):

Overload = multiple metrics >0.8.

Under-engagement = flat <0.3.

Fragmentation = coherence <0.3 for â‰¥2 consecutive steps.

ğŸš¨ Entry misalignment (Step 0) is always treated as a critical red flag.

Step 6. Visual Output Requirements

Produce at least one visual representation of the entire flow including Step 0:

Attention Flow Graph (steps vs. metric intensity).

Coherence Heatmap (steps Ã— metrics, color-coded).

Journey Map Overlay (nodes shaded green/yellow/red).

Step 7. Success Criteria Check

â‰¥70% of journey (including Step 0) within the optimal envelope.

Smooth intensity transitions.

Coherence â‰¥0.6 for most steps.

Recovery periods after demanding phases.

âœ… Step 0 must pass alignment, or overall journey cannot be rated as successful.
