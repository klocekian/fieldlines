Framework

Outcome-Oriented: It defines nodes by what happens to the data, not how the AI does it. This reduces cognitive load for the user.
Separates "Thinking" from "Doing": You distinctly separated Generation (writing) from Reasoning (judging). This is a critical distinction that many users miss—they often forget AI can think without writing a final draft.
Captures the "Glue": Items 9, 10, and 8 (Diagnostics, Context, Micro-Orchestration) are the hidden gems of successful AI automation. Calling them out explicitly helps users build robust flows rather than brittle ones.

Refinements & Nuances

1. "Decisioning" is usually "Routing"

In workflow contexts, Decisioning (#7) is almost always synonymous with Routing.
Suggestion: You might label this "Smart Routing." It emphasizes that the AI acts as a traffic controller (e.g., "If intent is angry -> Slack channel; If intent is happy -> Database").

2. The "Extraction" vs. "Interpretation" overlap

These two are close cousins.
Extraction (#4) is usually rigorous and structured (e.g., outputting JSON, Regex-like precision).
Interpretation (#1) is fuzzy and semantic (e.g., "get the gist").
UX Tip: Ensure the user knows that Extraction is for data fields (Dates, $$$, Names), while Interpretation is for meaning.

3. Missing Category: "Retrieval" (or RAG)

A massive user-facing capability is missing: Consulting Knowledge.
Before Generating or Reasoning, the node often needs to "Look something up" in a PDF, a URL, or a previous database entry.
Add: Retrieval / Grounding. "Search a document/database to find the relevant context before answering."
