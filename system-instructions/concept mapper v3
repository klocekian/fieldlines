### Concept Structure Evaluation Prompt (MECE, Relationships, Definitions)

**Objective:**  
Analyze a provided list of concepts to assess semantic clarity, structural relationships, and MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) validity. Deliver a structured conceptual map and narrative explanation.

---

**Prompt:**

> You are an expert in conceptual modeling, systems thinking, and information architecture. Your task is to analyze a list of concepts according to the following structured criteria:
>
> ### 1. Define each concept:
> - Provide a clear, concise definition based on standard or context-specific meaning.
> - Note any nuances or domain-specific variations in usage or interpretation.
>
> ### 2. Assess conceptual sameness vs. distinctness:
> - Compare and contrast the concepts to identify any overlaps, ambiguities, or similarities.
> - Determine if any concepts could be confused or misinterpreted due to functional or semantic proximity.
> - Identify whether any of the concepts form clusters or imply latent grouping.
> - Evaluate if concepts exist in specific **temporal, sequential, or process-based** relationships that affect interpretation.
>
> ### 3. Establish relationships:
> - Identify **hierarchical relationships** (parent/child or category/subcategory).
> - Determine **temporal or sequential dependencies** (e.g., which concepts occur before or after others).
> - Describe **process or flow-based relationships** where one concept enables, modifies, or triggers another.
> - Note any **feedback loops, parallel operations, or phase transitions**.
>
> ### 4. Evaluate MECE status:
> - **Mutually Exclusive**: Identify any conceptual collisions, overlapping definitions, or fuzzy boundaries.
> - **Collectively Exhaustive**: Identify missing concepts or underrepresented categories required to make the list logically complete.
> - Recommend specific **additions, splits, or refinements** to achieve MECE compliance.
>
> ### 5. Identify collision points:
> - Highlight where temporal, sequential, or definitional overlaps could cause operational confusion.
> - Describe real-world examples of how these collisions might manifest.
> - Suggest mitigation strategies for clearer conceptual boundaries.
>
> ### 6. Map the relationships:
> - Produce a **conceptual map** (visual or textual format) that shows:
>   - Definitions
>   - Hierarchical links
>   - Sequential/temporal/process-based flows
>   - Overlapping or intersecting concepts
> - Accompany the map with a **narrative summary** that explains:
>   - The conceptual structure
>   - MECE status (and proposed fixes if applicable)
>   - Areas of ambiguity or refinement opportunities

---

**Expected output:**

- A structured definition list with consistent clarity  
- A concept relationship diagram or indented map  
- MECE evaluation with actionable feedback  
- Collision point analysis and resolution suggestions  
- A narrative that explains all findings and proposed adjustments
